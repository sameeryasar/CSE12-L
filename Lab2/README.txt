Lab 2 - This lab consisted of using MML to build 4 registers that would save a keypad input. Two registers could be chosen as inputs for a 4-bit bitwise left rotation ALU where the output can also be used as an input for the registers.

To run simulation, press start and clear to reset the registers. Then use a keypad input to save to a certain register with the write address switches, then hit update. To use specific registers for the ALU, use the read address switches. To use the ALU output as an input, hit the select switch.
